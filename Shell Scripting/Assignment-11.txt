Create a script that interacts with the user. Prompt them to guess a secret number between 1 and 5. Read the guess from the terminal and assign it to a variable. Using the 'if' statement from the course, test that value to determine if they guessed the right number (you choose the correct value). If they do, display a success message, otherwise do nothing.

---------------------------------------------------------


#! /usr/bin/bash
correct_no=3
read -p "Guess number between 1 to 5 :" guess
if [ $guess -eq $correct_no ]
then
 echo "Success"
fi



output:

1)Guess number between 1 to 5 :4



2)Guess number between 1 to 5 :3
  Success
