Write a script that takes a single command line parameter intended to be the user's first name. Prompt the user for their age and read that into a variable. Using the appropriate method to make that command line parameter visible to a function, pass the age captured to the function and display a message to the user addressing them by name and confirming their age, add a calculation of their age in number of days.


----------------------------------------------------------------

#! /usr/bin/bash
fun()
{
 read name
 read -p "Enter age: " age
 days=$(expr $age \* 365 )
 echo -e "Hello! Mr. $name. Your age is $age years old \nAnd your age in days is $days"
}
fun



output:

vinay kumar
Enter age: 23
Hello! Mr. vinay kumar. Your age is 23 years old 
And your age in days is 8395
