We are going to use nested functions to simulate the kind of abstraction you find in many object oriented languages. Create the following structures in your script:

a function that defines two local variables to hole the number of arms and legs that a human being has.
nested functions, one for each a male and female, that contain the appropriate number of beards that each gender has.
capture the gender as a command line parameter.
test the command line parameter and call the appropriate functions in order to display the characteristics of the indicated gender.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#! /usr/bin/bash
beard()
{
 echo "$gender has $x beard"
}
hands_legs()
{
 local hands=2
 local legs=2
 echo "$gender has $hands hands and $legs legs"
 if [ $gender == "male" ]
 then
  x=1
  beard
 elif [ $gender == "female" ]
 then
  x=0
  beard
 fi
}
read gender
if [ $gender == "male" ] || [ $gender == "female" ]
then
 hands_legs
fi





output:

female
female has 2 hands and 2 legs
female has 0 beard
