We need to create a menu for our users. Display a menu containing three choices AND a choice to allow them to exit. Display that menu and prompt for a choice. Upon choosing the value, it should simply clear the screen and redisplay the menu (loop until the exit choice is given).

HOWEVER, we need to be sure that the end user cannot use CTL-C, CTL-Z or a KILL command to terminate the application. Add a 'trap' in the script to capture those attempts and provide instructions on how to exit the script using the menu choice instead.

#! /usr/bin/bash
vny()
{
 echo " "
 echo "To Exit, Please select from the menu"
 echo " Press Enter to select from the menu"
 sleep 2
}
x=1
trap vny SIGINT SIGKILL SIGTSTP
while [ $x -eq 1 ]
do
    echo "choose the following with numbers: "
    echo -e "1.Start \n2.Middle \n3.End \n4.exit "
    read -p "Enter: " inp
	if [ $inp -eq 4 ]
	then
	 x=$(( x+1 ))
    else
     echo $( clear )
     sleep 2
	fi
done	
exit 0
