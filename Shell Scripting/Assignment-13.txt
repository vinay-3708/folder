Write a script that assigns a variable that contains a list of all shell scripts (*.sh) in the current directory (command redirection). Using the 'for'statement from the course, iterate through that list of files and display the filename of each and cat out the contents to the terminal.

#! /usr/bin/bash
cmd="ls *.sh"
files=$( $cmd )
for x in $files
do
 echo $x
 while read line
 do
  echo "$line"
 done < $x

#! /usr/bin/bash
