Create a script to demonstrate the visibility of variables and when they are available within a script and its functions. Define a global variable, a function that defines a local variable and then display both BEFORE calling the function, call the function, then display both AFTER calling the function.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

#! /usr/bin/bash
name=vinay #outside of functions will be global varibales which are same throughout the program until we update it
fun()
{
 local name=kumar #local - is used to create local variable within this function.
 echo "calling the function: my name is $name "
}
echo "BEFORE calling the function: my name is $name"
fun
echo "AFTER calling the function: my name is $name"



output:

BEFORE calling the function: my name is vinay
calling the function: my name is kumar 
AFTER calling the function: my name is vinay
