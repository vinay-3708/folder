Create a simple script that does the following:

Echo a full sentence to the terminal
Echo a different full sentence, but redirect it to /dev/null

Run and display the results and make sure the statements appear where intended.




-----------------------------------------------
#! /usr/bin/bash
echo "This is Full Sentence-1" #prints on the terminal
echo "This is Full Sentence-2" > /dev/null  #overwrites the null
echo "This is Full Sentence-3" >> /dev/null  #appends the null
cat dev/null #To see the content of null
