Create a script that interacts with the user. You will want to prompt the user to enter the following information (which you will capture and place into the following variables):

FIRSTNAME
LASTNAME
USERAGE

Greet the user with their name and current age displayed and then calculate and display their age in 10 years.



----------------------------------------------------------

#! /usr/bin/bash
echo 'Enter the following - '
read -p "FIRST_NAME: " FIRSTNAME
read -p "LAST_NAME: " LASTNAME
read -p "USER_AGE: " USERAGE
echo -e "Hello! $FIRSTNAME $LASTNAME\nPresent_age is $USERAGE"
echo "`expr $USERAGE + 10 ` will be in 10 years"

output:

Enter the following - 
FIRST_NAME: vny
LAST_NAME: mtm
USER_AGE: 23
Hello! vny mtm
Present_age is 23
33 will be in 10 years
